#Sample Program No.1

This program is a simple guessing game (truly simple as the number isn't even random!). The user is prompted for a number and once the number is input, a case (check) statement checks the result and displays a message accordingly. The program terminates when the number is guessed.

```
END

-> (numIn !==> result) until

		->

				terminate!
				('Correct')nloutput
			:is == result:

				terminate!
				('Try again!')nloutput
				('Guess is too low')nloutput
			:is << result

				terminate!
				('Try again!')nloutput
				('Guess is too high')nloutput
			:is >> result

		<-(numIn) check

		(numIn)userinput

		('Guess a number')nloutput

<- execute

->

(number1**number2) ++ result ==> result

<-(++==> i; i << 10; 0 ==> i decimal) for

0 ==> numIn decimal
10 ==> number1 decimal constant
20 ==> number2 decimal constant

BEGIN

0==>result decimal
